# aec-hackathon

This repository is a result of the AEC-hackathon in Copenhagen 2020, where the hacking focuses on life cycle assesment and sustainability.

1. In order to start using the services provided in this repository, one must have Docker installed.

2. When docker is installed the docker-compose.yml file is initialized by running the command "docker-compose up" which spins up 1 angular application, 1 node express api and 3 fuseki databases.
